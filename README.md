- Katie Wald 5 stars
> Works like a charm. THANK YOU. After learning about Fandom's business practices (on top of their unnecessarily anti-consumer advertising), this feels great.

- Jackson Smyrl 5 stars
> Works like charm, makes fandom sites actually readable again.

- Thiago Ibaldi 5 stars
> Highly effective, it's a nice feeling not to give money for advertising to this site.

- A “Kiolo” M 5 stars
> Thank you so much for this blocker. I use it with my general ad block and it's like fandom is actually useable again. Blocks banners, those stupid autoplay videos and pop-ups.
